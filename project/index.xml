      <description>I decided to research the correlation between gun ownership and gun deaths in each state. I have titled the data sets GunMort, GovParty, and GunReg. In GunMort, each state, the number of their
total gun deaths by state, and the number of deaths by gun per 100,000 population by state is listed. This data was collected on the CDC website describing firearm mortality. In GovParty each state and the political party of the governor of each state is listed.</description>
