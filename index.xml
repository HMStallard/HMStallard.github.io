      <description>Python Why I am unhappy with my current ability. Despite, repeated attempts at inserting a small bit of python code in this blog post, I have not been able to get it to run how I want it. I was trying to run the exact same code from class but despite me knowing the code is able to be run, I can&#39;t get past this error.
Traceback (most recent call last): File &amp;quot;/tmp/RtmpJjxmpT/chunk-code-7fd2725a46b0.</description>

      <description>I decided to research the correlation between gun ownership and gun deaths in each state. I have titled the data sets GunMort, GovParty, and GunReg. In GunMort, each state, the number of their
total gun deaths by state, and the number of deaths by gun per 100,000 population by state is listed. This data was collected on the CDC website describing firearm mortality. In GovParty each state and the political party of the governor of each state is listed.</description>
